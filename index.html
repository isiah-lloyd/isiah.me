<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people
    who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get
    picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
    </p>

<div class="card animated slideInUp">
    <h1>Are you ready for the truth?</h1>
    <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace
        else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps,
        find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker.
        You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get
        shot. You understand? </p>
</div>
<h1>We happy?</h1>
<p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass
    motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass,
    'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

<h1>Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!</h1>
<p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional
    period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've
    already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

<h1>Is she dead, yes or no?</h1>
<p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't
    get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too
    fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on
    the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

<h1>Is she dead, yes or no?</h1>
<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people
    who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get
    picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
    </p>

<h1>Is she dead, yes or no?</h1>
<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you
    see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when
    you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because
    you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

<h1>Hold on to your butts</h1>
<p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell
    who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and
    me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>
